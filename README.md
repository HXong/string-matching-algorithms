This Git Repository analyses Boyer_moore and Rabin Karp algorithm on String Matching. The algorithm follows the implementation in NTU SC2001 - Algorithms Design and Analysis (String Matching)

The algorithm is coded in C while the testing of cases are done in python.

**Generation of test cases is done through the use parallel threading as large length of Text and Pattern has to be used in the analysis**
